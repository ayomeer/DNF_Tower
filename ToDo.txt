Being worked on								

- Find floor master for Tier 4
- Research server plugins (ayo's on the case)
- Decision if we use Webpage or only Server Settings.
    > Opinions/Arguments:
        *[Ayo]: In source games' community ranking systems it all runs on the server and it worked really well. If this is possible on 
                Quake servers i think it'd be preferable; Adds value to dnf servers, less componets the user needs to know about, less 
                effort spent on UI. However this does mean the deciding games can only be played on dnf servers.
