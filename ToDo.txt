Being worked on								

- Find floor master for Tier 4
- Research server plugins (ayo's on the case)
- Decision if we use Webpage or only Server Settings.
    > Opinions/Arguments:
        *[Ayo]: In source games' community ranking systems it all runs on the server and it worked really well. If this is possible on Quake servers
                i think it'd be preferable; Adds value to dnf servers, less componets the user needs to know about, less effort spent on UI.
    > Who would want to do it?
